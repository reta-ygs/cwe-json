This can lead to an unexpected system state and unpredictable results with a variety of potential consequences depending on context, including denial of service and code execution.", "Many functions are not reentrant, but some of them can result in the corruption of memory if they are used in a signal handler. The function call syslog() is an example of this. In order to perform its functionality, it allocates a small amount of memory as \"scratch space.\" If syslog() is suspended by a signal call and the signal handler calls syslog(), the memory used by both of these functions enters an undefined, and possibly, exploitable state. Implementations of malloc() and free() manage metadata in global structures in order to track which memory is allocated versus which memory is available, but they are non-reentrant. Simultaneous calls to these functions can cause corruption of the metadata."]}, "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": [{"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "828", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}, {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "663", "@View_ID": "1000"}, {"@Nature": "CanPrecede", "@CWE_ID": "123", "@View_ID": "1000"}]}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": [{"@Name": "C", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, {"@Name": "C++", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}]}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": {"Phase": "Implementation"}}, "Likelihood_Of_Exploit": "Low", "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": [{"Scope": ["Integrity", "Confidentiality", "Availability"], "Impact": "Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands", "Note": "It may be possible to execute arbitrary code through the use of a write-what-where condition."}, {"Scope": "Integrity", "Impact": ["Modify Memory", "Modify Application Data"], "Note": "Signal race conditions often result in data corruption."}]}, "Detection_Methods": {"Detection_Method": {"@Detection_Method_ID": "DM-14", "Method": "Automated Static Analysis", "Description": "Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
