For example, a compiler might convert an int to Integer (called autoboxing) or an Integer to int (called unboxing). This eliminates forcing the programmer to perform these conversions manually, which makes the code cleaner.", "However, this feature comes at a cost of performance and can lead to resource exhaustion and impact availability when used with generic collections.
