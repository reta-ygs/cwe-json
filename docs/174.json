Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8.

When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component."}, {"@Mitigation_ID": "MIT-20", "Phase": "Implementation", "Strategy": "Input Validation", "Description": "Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180).
