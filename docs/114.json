The application can execute code contained in the native libraries, which often contain calls that are susceptible to other security problems, such as buffer overflows or command injection. All native libraries should be validated to determine if the application requires the use of the library. It is very difficult to determine what these native libraries actually do, and the potential for malicious code is high. In addition, the potential for an inadvertent mistake in these native libraries is also high, as many are written in C or C++ and may be susceptible to buffer overflow or race condition problems. To help prevent buffer overflow attacks, validate all input to native calls for content and length. If the native library does not come from a trusted source, review the source code of the library. The library should be built from the reviewed source before using it."}}, "Demonstrative_Examples": {"Demonstrative_Example": [{"Intro_Text": "The following code uses System.loadLibrary() to load code from a native library named library.dll, which is normally found in a standard system directory.", "Example_Code": {"@Nature": "Bad", "@Language": "Java", "xhtml:div": {"xhtml:br": [null, null], "#text": "...System.loadLibrary(\"library.dll\");..."}}, "Body_Text": "The problem here is that System.loadLibrary() accepts a library name, not a path, for the library to be loaded. From the Java 1.4.2 API documentation this function behaves as follows [1]: A file containing native code is loaded from the local file system from a place where library files are conventionally obtained. The details of this process are implementation-dependent. The mapping from a library name to a specific filename is done in a system-specific manner. If an attacker is able to place a malicious copy of library.dll higher in the search order than file the application intends to load, then the application will load the malicious copy instead of the intended file. Because of the nature of the application, it runs with elevated privileges, which means the contents of the attacker's library.dll will now be run with elevated privileges, possibly giving them complete control of the system."}, {"Intro_Text": "The following code from a privileged application uses a registry entry to determine the directory in which it is installed and loads a library file based on a relative path from the specified directory.", "Example_Code": {"@Nature": "Bad", "@Language": "C", "xhtml:div": {"xhtml:br": [null, null, null, null, null], "xhtml:div": {"@style": "margin-left:1em;", "xhtml:div": {"xhtml:br": [null, null, null], "#text": "strcpy(lib,home);strcat(lib,INITCMD);LoadLibrary(lib);"}}, "#text": "...RegQueryValueEx(hkey, \"APPHOME\",0, 0, (BYTE*)home, &size);char* lib=(char*)malloc(strlen(home)+strlen(INITLIB));if (lib) {}..."}}, "Body_Text": "The code in this example allows an attacker to load an arbitrary library, from which code will be executed with the elevated privilege of the application, by modifying a registry key to specify a different path containing a malicious version of INITLIB.

The type of attack seen in this example is made possible because of the search order used by LoadLibrary() when an absolute path is not specified. If the current directory is searched before system directories, as was the case up until the most recent versions of Windows, then this type of attack becomes trivial if the attacker can execute the program locally. The search order is operating system version dependent, and is controlled on newer operating systems by the value of the registry key: HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\SafeDllSearchMode"}]}, "Affected_Resources": {"Affected_Resource": "System Process"}, "Taxonomy_Mappings": {"Taxonomy_Mapping": {"@Taxonomy_Name": "7 Pernicious Kingdoms", "Entry_Name": "Process Control"}}, "Related_Attack_Patterns": {"Related_Attack_Pattern": [{"@CAPEC_ID": "108"}, {"@CAPEC_ID": "640"}]}, "References": {"Reference": {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-6"}}, "Notes": {"Note": [{"@Type": "Maintenance", "#text": "CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000.
