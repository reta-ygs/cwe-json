Very often the password recovery mechanism is weak, which has the effect of making it more likely that it would be possible for a person other than the legitimate system user to gain access to that user's account. Weak password recovery schemes completely undermine a strong password authentication scheme.", "This weakness may be that the security question is too easy to guess or find an answer to (e.g. because the question is too common, or the answers can be found using social media). Or there might be an implementation weakness in the password recovery mechanism code that may for instance trick the system into e-mailing the new password to an e-mail account other than that of the user. There might be no throttling done on the rate of password resets so that a legitimate user can be denied service by an attacker if an attacker tries to recover their password in a rapid succession. The system may send the original password to the user rather than generating a new temporary password. In summary, password recovery functionality, if not carefully designed and implemented can often become the system's weakest link that can be misused in a way that would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system."]}, "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": [{"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "1390", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}, {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "287", "@View_ID": "1003", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}]}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Note": "COMMISSION: This weakness refers to an incorrect design related to an architectural security tactic."}, {"Phase": "Implementation"}]}, "Likelihood_Of_Exploit": "High", "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": [{"Scope": "Access Control", "Impact": "Gain Privileges or Assume Identity", "Note": "An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the system by retrieving legitimate user's authentication credentials."}, {"Scope": "Availability", "Impact": "DoS: Resource Consumption (Other)", "Note": "An attacker could deny service to legitimate system users by launching a brute force attack on the password recovery mechanism using user ids of legitimate users."}, {"Scope": ["Integrity", "Other"], "Impact": "Other", "Note": "The system's security functionality is turned against the system by the attacker."}]}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Description": "Make sure that all input supplied by the user to the password recovery mechanism is thoroughly filtered and validated."}, {"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Description": "Do not use standard weak security questions and use several security questions."}, {"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Description": "Make sure that there is throttling on the number of incorrect answers to a security question.

After three incorrect log in attempts, eBay password throttling would kick in and lock out the highest bidder's account for some time.
