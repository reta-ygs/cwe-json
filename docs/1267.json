Among various types of message information, a typical transaction is comprised of source identity (identifying the originator of the transaction) and a destination identity (routing the transaction to the respective entity). Sometimes the transactions are qualified with a Security Token. This Security Token helps the destination agent decide on the set of allowed actions (e.g., access to an asset for reads and writes). A policy encoder is used to map the bus transactions to Security Tokens that in turn are used as access-controls/protection mechanisms. A common weakness involves using an encoding which is no longer trusted, i.e., an obsolete encoding."}, "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "284", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Operating_System": {"@Class": "Not OS-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Architecture": {"@Class": "Not Architecture-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Technology": {"@Class": "Not Technology-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design"}, {"Phase": "Implementation"}]}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": ["Confidentiality", "Integrity", "Availability", "Access Control"], "Impact": ["Modify Memory", "Read Memory", "Modify Files or Directories", "Read Files or Directories", "DoS: Resource Consumption (Other)", "Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands", "Gain Privileges or Assume Identity", "Bypass Protection Mechanism", "Reduce Reliability"], "Likelihood": "High"}}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": {"Phase": ["Architecture and Design", "Implementation"], "Description": {"xhtml:p": ["Security Token Decoders should be reviewed for design inconsistency and common weaknesses.", "Access and programming flows should be tested in both pre-silicon and post-silicon testing."]}, "Effectiveness": "High"}}, "Demonstrative_Examples": {"Demonstrative_Example": {"Intro_Text": {"xhtml:p": ["For example, consider a system that has four bus masters.
