Typical steps in IC reverse engineering involve removing the chip packaging (decapsulation) then using various imaging techniques ranging from high resolution x-ray microscopy to invasive techniques involving removing IC layers and imaging each layer using a scanning electron microscope.", "The goal of such activities is to recover secret keys, unique device identifiers, and proprietary code and circuit designs embedded in hardware that the attacker has been unsuccessful at accessing through other means. These secrets may be stored in non-volatile memory or in the circuit netlist. Memory technologies such as masked ROM allow easier to extraction of secrets than One-time Programmable (OTP) memory."]}, "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "693", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Operating_System": {"@Class": "Not OS-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Architecture": {"@Class": "Not Architecture-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Technology": {"@Class": "Not Technology-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": {"Phase": "Architecture and Design"}}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": "Confidentiality", "Impact": "Varies by Context", "Note": "A common goal of malicious actors who reverse engineer ICs is to produce and sell counterfeit versions of the IC."}}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": {"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Description": "The cost of secret extraction via IC reverse engineering should outweigh the potential value of the secrets being extracted.

The key is baked into the design logic and may not be modified after fabrication causing the key to be identical for all devices.  An attacker in possession of the IC can decapsulate and delayer the device. After imaging the layers, computer vision algorithms or manual inspection of the circuit features locate the ROM and reveal the value of the key bits as encoded in the visible circuit structure of the ROM."}}, "Related_Attack_Patterns": {"Related_Attack_Pattern": [{"@CAPEC_ID": "188"}, {"@CAPEC_ID": "37"}, {"@CAPEC_ID": "545"}]}, "References": {"Reference": [{"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1092"}, {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1129"}]}, "Notes": {"Note": {"@Type": "Maintenance", "#text": "This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.
