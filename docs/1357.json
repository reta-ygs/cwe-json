For example, a hardware component might be built by a separate supplier, or the product might use an open-source software library from a third party.", "Regardless of the source, each component should be sufficiently trusted to ensure correct, secure operation of the product. If a component is not trustworthy, it can produce significant risks for the overall product, such as vulnerabilities that cannot be patched fast enough (if at all); hidden functionality such as malware; inability to update or replace the component if needed for security purposes; hardware components built from parts that do not meet specifications in ways that can lead to weaknesses; etc. Note that a component might not be trustworthy even if it is owned by the product vendor, such as a software component whose source code is lost and was built by developers who left the company, or a component that was developed by a separate company that was acquired and brought into the product's own company.", "Note that there can be disagreement as to whether a component is sufficiently trustworthy, since trust is ultimately subjective. Different stakeholders (e.g., customers, vendors, governments) have various threat models and ways to assess trust, and design/architecture choices might make tradeoffs between security, reliability, safety, privacy, cost, and other characteristics."]}, "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "710", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}}, "Weakness_Ordinalities": {"Weakness_Ordinality": {"Ordinality": "Indirect"}}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Architecture": {"@Class": "Not Architecture-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Technology": [{"@Class": "Not Technology-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, {"@Class": "ICS/OT", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}]}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": [{"Phase": "Requirements", "Note": "Requirements might include criteria for which the only available solutions are provided by insufficiently trusted components."}, {"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Note": "An insufficiently trusted component might be selected because it is less expensive to do in-house, requires expertise that is not available in-house, or might allow the product to reach the market faster."}]}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": "Other", "Impact": "Reduce Maintainability"}}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": [{"Phase": ["Requirements", "Architecture and Design", "Implementation"], "Description": "For each component, ensure that its supply chain is well-controlled with sub-tier suppliers using best practices.
