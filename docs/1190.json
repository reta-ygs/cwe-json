An attacker could exploit this to\n              access secrets. Several virtualization-based mitigations have been introduced to thwart DMA attacks. These are usually\n              configured/setup during boot time. However, certain IPs that are\n              powered up before boot is complete (known as early boot IPs) may\n              be DMA capable. Such IPs, if not trusted, could launch DMA\n              attacks and gain access to assets that should otherwise be\n              protected."}, "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "696", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Technology": {"@Class": "System on Chip", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": {"Phase": "Architecture and Design"}}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": "Access Control", "Impact": ["Bypass Protection Mechanism", "Modify Memory"], "Likelihood": "High", "Note": "DMA devices have direct write access to main memory and\n                 due to time of attack will be able to bypass OS or Bootloader\n                 access control."}}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": {"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Description": "Utilize an IOMMU to orchestrate IO access from\n                 the start of the boot process."}}, "Related_Attack_Patterns": {"Related_Attack_Pattern": {"@CAPEC_ID": "180"}}, "References": {"Reference": [{"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1038"}, {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1039"}, {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1040"}, {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1041"}, {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1042"}, {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1044"}, {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1046"}]}, "Content_History": {"Submission": {"Submission_Name": "Arun Kanuparthi, Hareesh Khattri, Parbati Kumar Manna, Narasimha Kumar V Mangipudi", "Submission_Organization": "Intel Corporation", "Submission_Date": "2019-10-15"}, "Modification": [{"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2020-08-20", "Modification_Comment": "updated Related_Attack_Patterns"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2023-04-27", "Modification_Comment": "updated References, Relationships"}]}}
