The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88)."}, {"@Mitigation_ID": "MIT-20", "Phase": "Implementation", "Strategy": "Input Validation", "Description": "Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180).
