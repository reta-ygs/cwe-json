Input validation will not always prevent XSS, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, in a chat application, the heart emoticon (\"<3\") would likely pass the validation step, since it is commonly used. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the web page because it contains the \"<\" character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the \"<\" might reduce the risk of XSS, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the emoticon would not be recorded.
