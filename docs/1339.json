If the fraction can be represented in a fixed number of digits (binary or decimal), there might not be enough digits assigned to represent the number. In other cases the number cannot be represented in a fixed number of digits due to repeating in decimal or binary notation (e.g. 0.333333...) or due to a transcendental number such as \u03a0 or \u221a2.

In the demonstrative example about Muller's Recurrence, the fraction 108.0 - ((815.0 - 1500.0 / z) / y) cannot be represented in 8 binary digits. The numeric accuracy within languages such as PL/1, COBOL and Ada is expressed in decimal digits rather than binary digits.

This allows flexibility for more accuracy when the integer portion is smaller. When dealing with large integers, the fractional accuracy is less.
