These actions could be \"read\", \"write\", \"program\", \"reset\", \"fetch\", \"compute\", etc. Security Tokens are generated and assigned to every agent on the SoC that is either capable of generating an action or receiving an action from another agent. Every agent could be assigned a unique, Security Token based on its trust level or privileges. Incorrectly generated Security Tokens could result in the same token used for multiple agents or multiple tokens being used for the same agent.

There could be a maximum of 32 Security Tokens that are allowed access to the AES-key registers. When set (bit = \"1\") bit number allows action from an agent whose identity matches that bit number.
