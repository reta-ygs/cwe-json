In some cases, an attacker cannot predict the exact value that will be produced next, but can narrow down the possibilities significantly. This reduces the amount of effort to perform a brute force attack. For example, suppose the product generates random numbers between 1 and 100, but it always produces a larger value until it reaches 100. If the generator produces an 80, then the attacker knows that the next value will be somewhere between 81 and 100. Instead of 100 possibilities, the attacker only needs to consider 20.", "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "340", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design"}, {"Phase": "Implementation"}]}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": "Other", "Impact": "Varies by Context"}}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": [{"Description": "Increase the entropy used to seed a PRNG."}, {"@Mitigation_ID": "MIT-2", "Phase": ["Architecture and Design", "Requirements"], "Strategy": "Libraries or Frameworks", "Description": "Use products or modules that conform to FIPS 140-2 [REF-267] to avoid obvious entropy problems.
