It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.", "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "707", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}}, "Weakness_Ordinalities": {"Weakness_Ordinality": {"Ordinality": "Primary"}}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": {"Phase": "Implementation", "Note": "REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic."}}, "Likelihood_Of_Exploit": "High", "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": [{"Scope": "Confidentiality", "Impact": "Read Application Data", "Note": "Many injection attacks involve the disclosure of important information -- in terms of both data sensitivity and usefulness in further exploitation."}, {"Scope": "Access Control", "Impact": "Bypass Protection Mechanism", "Note": "In some cases, injectable code controls authentication; this may lead to a remote vulnerability."}, {"Scope": "Other", "Impact": "Alter Execution Logic", "Note": "Injection attacks are characterized by the ability to significantly change the flow of a given process, and in some cases, to the execution of arbitrary code."}, {"Scope": ["Integrity", "Other"], "Impact": "Other", "Note": "Data injection attacks lead to loss of data integrity in nearly all cases as the control-plane data injected is always incidental to data recall or writing."}, {"Scope": "Non-Repudiation", "Impact": "Hide Activities", "Note": "Often the actions performed by injected control code are unlogged."}]}, "Detection_Methods": {"Detection_Method": {"@Detection_Method_ID": "DM-14", "Method": "Automated Static Analysis", "Description": "Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
