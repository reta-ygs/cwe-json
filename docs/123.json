Also, they almost invariably can be used to execute arbitrary code, which is usually outside the scope of a program's implicit security policy. If the attacker can overwrite a pointer's worth of memory (usually 32 or 64 bits), they can redirect a function pointer to their own malicious code. Even when the attacker can only modify a single byte arbitrary code execution can be possible. Sometimes this is because the same problem can be exploited repeatedly to the same effect.

Particularly, there may be a \"previous\" chunk and a \"next\" chunk. Here, the previous chunk for buf2 will probably be buf1, and the next chunk may be null. When the free() occurs, most memory allocators will rewrite the linked list using data from buf2. Particularly, the \"next\" chunk for buf1 will be updated and the \"previous\" chunk for any subsequent chunk will be updated. The attacker can insert a memory address for the \"next\" chunk and a value to write into that memory address for the \"previous\" chunk.", "This could be used to overwrite a function pointer that
