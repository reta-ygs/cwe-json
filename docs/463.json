A common example of this is the null character at the end of strings. Another common example is linked lists which may contain a sentinel to mark the end of the list. It is dangerous to allow this type of control data to be easily accessible. Therefore, it is important to protect from the deletion or modification outside of some wrapper interface which provides safety.", "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": [{"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "707", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}, {"@Nature": "PeerOf", "@CWE_ID": "464", "@View_ID": "1000"}]}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": [{"@Name": "C", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, {"@Name": "C++", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}]}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": {"Phase": "Implementation"}}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": [{"Scope": ["Availability", "Other"], "Impact": "Other", "Note": "Generally this error will cause the data structure to not work properly."}, {"Scope": ["Authorization", "Other"], "Impact": "Other", "Note": "If a control character, such as NULL is removed, one may cause resource access control problems."}]}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Description": "Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs.
