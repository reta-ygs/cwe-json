These errors are random, and \n            their causes might be internal (e.g., interconnect coupling) or external \n            (e.g., cosmic radiation). These soft errors are not permanent in nature \n            and cause temporary bit flips known as single-event upsets (SEUs). \n            SEUs are induced errors in circuits caused when charged particles lose \n            energy by ionizing the medium through which they pass, leaving behind a \n            wake of electron-hole pairs that cause temporary failures. If these \n            failures occur in security-sensitive modules in a chip, it might \n            compromise the security guarantees of the chip.
