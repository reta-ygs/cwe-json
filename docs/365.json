{"@ID": "365", "@Name": "DEPRECATED: Race Condition in Switch", "@Abstraction": "Base", "@Structure": "Simple", "@Status": "Deprecated", "Description": "This entry has been deprecated. There are no documented cases in which a switch's control expression is evaluated more than once.", "Extended_Description": "It is likely that this entry was initially created based on a misinterpretation of the original source material. The original source intended to explain how switches could be unpredictable when using threads, if the control expressions used data or variables that could change between execution of different threads. That weakness is already covered by CWE-367. Despite the ambiguity in the documentation for some languages and compilers, in practice, they all evaluate the switch control expression only once. If future languages state that the code explicitly evaluates the control expression more than once, then this would not be a weakness, but the language performing as designed.", "Notes": {"Note": {"@Type": "Mapping", "xhtml:p": ["Use for Mapping: Prohibited (this CWE ID must not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities).", "Rationale: This CWE has been deprecated.", "Comments: see description for suggestions of other CWEs to consider."]}}, "Content_History": {"Submission": {"Submission_Name": "CLASP", "Submission_Date": "2006-07-19"}, "Modification": [{"Modification_Name": "Eric Dalci", "Modification_Organization": "Cigital", "Modification_Date": "2008-07-01", "Modification_Comment": "updated Time_of_Introduction"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2008-09-08", "Modification_Comment": "updated Applicable_Platforms, Common_Consequences, Relationships, Other_Notes, Taxonomy_Mappings"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2008-11-24", "Modification_Comment": "updated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2010-09-27", "Modification_Comment": "updated Relationships"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2011-06-01", "Modification_Comment": "updated Common_Consequences"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2011-06-27", "Modification_Comment": "updated Common_Consequences"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2012-05-11", "Modification_Comment": "updated Demonstrative_Examples, References, Relationships"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2014-06-23", "Modification_Comment": "updated Common_Consequences, Description, Other_Notes, Potential_Mitigations"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2014-07-30", "Modification_Comment": "updated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2017-11-08", "Modification_Comment": "updated Demonstrative_Examples"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2019-01-03", "Modification_Comment": "updated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2020-02-24", "Modification_Comment": "updated Description, References, Relationships"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2022-04-28", "Modification_Comment": "updated Applicable_Platforms, Common_Consequences, Demonstrative_Examples, Description, Likelihood_of_Exploit, Name, Potential_Mitigations, References, Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings, Time_of_Introduction, Type"}], "Contribution": {"@Type": "Feedback", "Contribution_Name": "Yongchool Ryu, MathWorks; Roberto Bagnara, BUGSENG; Guido Persch, Imagix; John Blattner, Imagix; Paul Anderson, GrammaTech; Fulvio Baccaglini; John Viega; Robert Seacord; Members of the CWE-Research mailing list, including Jonathan Hood and Steve Grubb; Commenters on Twitter, including Patricia Aas, Myria, Richard Barrell, and others", "Contribution_Date": "2022-03-31", "Contribution_Comment": "Many members of the CWE community contributed important feedback supporting deprecation of this entry.
