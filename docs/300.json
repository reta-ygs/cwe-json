Inadequate or inconsistent verification may result in insufficient or incorrect identification of either communicating entity. This can have negative consequences such as misplaced trust in the entity at the other end of the channel. An attacker can leverage this by interposing between the communicating entities and masquerading as the original entity. In the absence of sufficient verification of identity, such an attacker can eavesdrop and potentially modify the communication between the original entities.", "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "923", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}}, "Alternate_Terms": {"Alternate_Term": [{"Term": "Adversary-in-the-Middle / AITM"}, {"Term": "Man-in-the-Middle / MITM"}, {"Term": "Person-in-the-Middle / PITM"}, {"Term": "Monkey-in-the-Middle"}, {"Term": "Monster-in-the-Middle"}, {"Term": "On-path attack"}, {"Term": "Interception attack"}]}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": {"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Note": "REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic."}}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": ["Confidentiality", "Integrity", "Access Control"], "Impact": ["Read Application Data", "Modify Application Data", "Gain Privileges or Assume Identity"], "Note": "An attacker could pose as one of the entities and read or possibly modify the communication."}}, "Detection_Methods": {"Detection_Method": {"@Detection_Method_ID": "DM-14", "Method": "Automated Static Analysis", "Description": "Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
