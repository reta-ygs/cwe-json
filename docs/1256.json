This assumption may be false if the\n              device has improperly secured power management features,\n              or similar features.  For mobile devices, minimizing\n              power consumption is critical, but these devices run a\n              wide variety of applications with different performance\n              requirements. Software-controllable mechanisms to\n              dynamically scale device voltage and frequency and\n              monitor power consumption are common features in today's\n              chipsets, but they also enable attackers to mount fault\n              injection and side-channel attacks without having\n              physical access to the device.", "Fault injection attacks involve strategic\n              manipulation of bits in a device to achieve a desired\n              effect such as skipping an authentication step,\n              elevating privileges, or altering the output of a\n              cryptographic operation.  Manipulation of the device\n              clock and voltage supply is a well-known technique to\n              inject faults and is cheap to implement with physical\n              device access.  Poorly protected power management\n              features allow these attacks to be performed from\n              software.  Other features, such as the ability to write\n              repeatedly to DRAM at a rapid rate from unprivileged\n              software, can result in bit flips in other memory\n              locations (Rowhammer, [REF-1083]).", "Side channel analysis requires gathering\n\t\t\t  measurement traces of physical quantities such as power\n\t\t\t  consumption.
