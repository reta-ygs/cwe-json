In many cases, a loop does not need to be infinite in order to cause enough resource consumption to adversely affect the product or its host system; it depends on the amount of resources consumed per iteration.", "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "691", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": "Availability", "Impact": ["DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU)", "DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory)", "DoS: Amplification", "DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart"], "Note": "Excessive looping will cause unexpected consumption of resources, such as CPU cycles or memory. The product's operation may slow down, or cause a long time to respond.
