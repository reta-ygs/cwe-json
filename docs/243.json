This does not prevent access to files outside of the jail.", "Extended_Description": "Improper use of chroot() may allow attackers to escape from the chroot jail.

After properly invoking chroot(), a process cannot access any files outside the directory tree defined by the new root directory. Such an environment is called a chroot jail and is commonly used to prevent the possibility that a processes could be subverted and used to access unauthorized files.
