Within a System on Chip (SoC), the IP block subsystems could be using different bus protocols. In such a case, the IP blocks are then linked to the central bus (and to other IP blocks) through a fabric bridge. Bridges are used as bus-interconnect-routing modules that link different protocols or separate, different segments of the overall SoC interconnect.", "For overall system security, it is important that the access-control privileges associated with any fabric transaction are consistently maintained and applied, even when they are routed or translated by a fabric bridge. A bridge that is connected to a fabric without security features forwards transactions to the slave without checking the privilege level of the master and results in a weakness in SoC access-control security. The same weakness occurs if a bridge does not check the hardware identity of the transaction received from the slave interface of the bridge."]}, "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "284", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Operating_System": {"@Class": "Not OS-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Architecture": {"@Class": "Not Architecture-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Technology": [{"@Name": "Processor Hardware", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, {"@Class": "Not Technology-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}]}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design"}, {"Phase": "Implementation"}]}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": ["Confidentiality", "Integrity", "Access Control", "Availability"], "Impact": ["DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart", "Bypass Protection Mechanism", "Read Memory", "Modify Memory"], "Likelihood": "Medium"}}, "Detection_Methods": {"Detection_Method": [{"Method": "Simulation / Emulation", "Description": "RTL simulation to ensure that bridge-access controls are implemented properly.", "Effectiveness": "High"}, {"Method": "Formal Verification", "Description": "Formal verification of bridge RTL to ensure that access control cannot be bypassed.", "Effectiveness": "High"}]}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Description": "Ensure that the design includes provisions for access-control checks in the bridge for both upstream and downstream transactions."}, {"Phase": "Implementation", "Description": "Implement access-control checks in the bridge for both upstream and downstream transactions."}]}, "Demonstrative_Examples": {"Demonstrative_Example": {"Intro_Text": "This example is from CVE-2019-6260 [REF-1138].
