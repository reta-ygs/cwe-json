Without mechanisms such as aging, users might not change their passwords in a timely manner.", "Note that while password aging was once considered an important security feature, it has since fallen out of favor by many, because it is not as effective against modern threats compared to other mechanisms such as slow hashes. In addition, forcing frequent changes can unintentionally encourage users to select less-secure passwords. However, password aging is still in use due to factors such as compliance requirements, e.g., Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)."]}, "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": [{"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "1390", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}, {"@Nature": "PeerOf", "@CWE_ID": "309", "@View_ID": "1000"}, {"@Nature": "PeerOf", "@CWE_ID": "324", "@View_ID": "1000"}]}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": {"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Note": "COMMISSION: This weakness refers to an incorrect design related to an architectural security tactic."}}, "Likelihood_Of_Exploit": "Low", "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": "Access Control", "Impact": "Gain Privileges or Assume Identity", "Note": "As passwords age, the probability that they are compromised grows."}}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Description": "As part of a product's design, require users to change their passwords regularly and avoid reusing previous passwords."}, {"Phase": "Implementation", "Description": "Developers might disable clipboard paste operations into password fields as a way to discourage users from pasting a password into a clipboard.
