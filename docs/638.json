In complex applications with many inputs, the developer often misses a parameter here or a cookie there. One frequently-applied solution is to centralize all input validation, store these validated inputs in a separate data structure, and require that all access of those inputs must be through that data structure. An alternate approach would be to use an external input validation framework such as Struts, which performs the validation before the inputs are ever processed by the code."}]}, "Observed_Examples": {"Observed_Example": {"Reference": "CVE-2007-0408", "Description": "Server does not properly validate client certificates when reusing cached connections.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0408"}}, "Taxonomy_Mappings": {"Taxonomy_Mapping": {"@Taxonomy_Name": "Software Fault Patterns", "Entry_ID": "SFP20", "Entry_Name": "Race Condition Window"}}, "Related_Attack_Patterns": {"Related_Attack_Pattern": {"@CAPEC_ID": "104"}}, "References": {"Reference": [{"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-196"}, {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-526"}]}, "Content_History": {"Submission": {"Submission_Name": "Pascal Meunier", "Submission_Organization": "Purdue University", "Submission_Date": "2008-01-18"}, "Modification": [{"Modification_Name": "Eric Dalci", "Modification_Organization": "Cigital", "Modification_Date": "2008-07-01", "Modification_Comment": "updated Time_of_Introduction"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2008-09-08", "Modification_Comment": "updated Common_Consequences, Relationships, Observed_Example, Weakness_Ordinalities"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2009-01-12", "Modification_Comment": "updated Description, Name"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2009-05-27", "Modification_Comment": "updated Related_Attack_Patterns"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2010-12-13", "Modification_Comment": "updated Name"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2011-06-01", "Modification_Comment": "updated Common_Consequences, Relationships"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2012-05-11", "Modification_Comment": "updated Relationships"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2012-10-30", "Modification_Comment": "updated Potential_Mitigations"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2014-07-30", "Modification_Comment": "updated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2017-11-08", "Modification_Comment": "updated Applicable_Platforms, Causal_Nature"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2020-02-24", "Modification_Comment": "updated Relationships"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2022-10-13", "Modification_Comment": "updated References"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2023-01-31", "Modification_Comment": "updated Description, Relationships"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2023-04-27", "Modification_Comment": "updated References, Relationships, Time_of_Introduction"}], "Previous_Entry_Name": [{"@Date": "2009-01-12", "#text": "Design Principle Violation: Not Using Complete Mediation"}, {"@Date": "2010-12-13", "#text": "Failure to Use Complete Mediation"}]}}, "copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2006\u20132023, The MITRE Corporation.
