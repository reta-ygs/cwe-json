This can provide cover for an attacker while attempting to penetrate a system, clutter the audit trail for forensic analysis, or make it more difficult to debug problems in a production environment.", "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "400", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": {"Phase": "Operation", "Note": "REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic."}}, "Likelihood_Of_Exploit": "Low", "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": [{"Scope": "Availability", "Impact": ["DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU)", "DoS: Resource Consumption (Other)"], "Note": "Log files can become so large that they consume excessive resources, such as disk and CPU, which can hinder the performance of the system."}, {"Scope": "Non-Repudiation", "Impact": "Hide Activities", "Note": "Logging too much information can make the log files of less use to forensics analysts and developers when trying to diagnose a problem or recover from an attack."}, {"Scope": "Non-Repudiation", "Impact": "Hide Activities", "Note": "If system administrators are unable to effectively process log files, attempted attacks may go undetected, possibly leading to eventual system compromise."}]}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Description": "Suppress large numbers of duplicate log messages and replace them with periodic summaries.
