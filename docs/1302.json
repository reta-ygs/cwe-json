A transaction is sent without a security identifier.", "Extended_Description": {"xhtml:p": ["In a System-On-Chip (SoC), various integrated circuits and hardware engines generate transactions such as to access (reads/writes) assets or perform certain actions (e.g., reset, fetch, compute). A typical transaction is comprised of source identity (to identify the originator of the transaction) and a destination identity (to route the transaction to the respective entity) in addition to much more information in the message. Sometimes the transactions are qualified with a Security Identifier.  This Security Identifier helps the destination agent decide on the set of allowed or disallowed actions.", "A common weakness that can exist in such transaction schemes is that the source agent fails to include the necessary, security identifier with the transaction.  Because of the missing security identifier, the destination agent might drop the message, thus resulting in Denial-of-Service (DoS), or get confused in its attempt to execute the given action, which confusion could result in privilege escalation or a gain of unintended access."]}, "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "1294", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Operating_System": {"@Class": "Not OS-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Architecture": {"@Class": "Not Architecture-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Technology": {"@Class": "Not Technology-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Note": "Such issues could be introduced during hardware architecture and design and identified later during Testing or System Configuration phases."}, {"Phase": "Implementation", "Note": "Such issues could be introduced during implementation and identified later during Testing or System Configuration phases."}]}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": ["Confidentiality", "Integrity", "Availability", "Access Control"], "Impact": ["Modify Memory", "Read Memory", "DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart", "Bypass Protection Mechanism", "Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands"], "Likelihood": "High"}}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Description": "Transaction details must be reviewed for design inconsistency and common weaknesses."}, {"Phase": "Implementation", "Description": "Security identifier definition and programming flow must be tested in pre-silicon and post-silicon testing."}]}, "Demonstrative_Examples": {"Demonstrative_Example": {"Intro_Text": {"xhtml:p": ["Consider a system with a register for storing AES key for encryption or decryption.
