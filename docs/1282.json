A golden digest is stored on the device and compared to the digest computed from the data to be verified. If the digests match, the data has not been maliciously modified. If an attacker can modify the golden digest they then have the ability to store arbitrary data that passes the verification check. Hash digests used to verify public keys and early stage boot code should be immutable, with the strongest protection offered by hardware immutability."}}, "Related_Attack_Patterns": {"Related_Attack_Pattern": [{"@CAPEC_ID": "458"}, {"@CAPEC_ID": "679"}]}, "Notes": {"Note": [{"@Type": "Maintenance", "#text": "This entry is still under development and will continue to\n          see updates and content improvements."}, {"@Type": "Maintenance", "#text": "As of CWE 4.3, CWE-1282 and CWE-1233 are being investigated\n\t\t  for potential duplication or overlap."}]}, "Content_History": {"Submission": {"Submission_Name": "Nicole Fern", "Submission_Organization": "Tortuga Logic", "Submission_Date": "2020-05-15"}, "Modification": [{"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2020-08-20", "Modification_Comment": "updated Demonstrative_Examples, Description, Modes_of_Introduction, Name"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2021-03-15", "Modification_Comment": "updated Maintenance_Notes"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2021-07-20", "Modification_Comment": "updated Related_Attack_Patterns"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2022-04-28", "Modification_Comment": "updated Related_Attack_Patterns"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2023-01-31", "Modification_Comment": "updated Related_Attack_Patterns"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2023-04-27", "Modification_Comment": "updated Relationships"}], "Previous_Entry_Name": {"@Date": "2020-08-20", "#text": "Assumed-Immutable Data Stored in Writable Memory"}}}, "copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2006\u20132023, The MITRE Corporation.
