{"cwe": {"@ID": "1253", "@Name": "Incorrect Selection of Fuse Values", "@Abstraction": "Base", "@Structure": "Simple", "@Status": "Draft", "Description": "The logic level used to set a system to a secure state relies on a fuse being unblown. An attacker can set the system to an insecure state merely by blowing the fuse.", "Extended_Description": {"xhtml:p": "Fuses are often used to store secret data, including security configuration data. When not blown, a fuse is considered to store a logic 0, and, when blown, it indicates a logic 1. Fuses are generally considered to be one-directional, i.e., once blown to logic 1, it cannot be reset to logic 0. However, if the logic used to determine system-security state (by leveraging the values sensed from the fuses) uses negative logic, an attacker might blow the fuse and drive the system to an insecure state."}, "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "693", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Operating_System": {"@Class": "Not OS-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Architecture": {"@Class": "Not Architecture-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Technology": {"@Class": "Not Technology-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design"}, {"Phase": "Implementation"}]}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": [{"Scope": ["Access Control", "Authorization"], "Impact": ["Bypass Protection Mechanism", "Gain Privileges or Assume Identity"]}, {"Scope": "Availability", "Impact": "DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart"}, {"Scope": "Confidentiality", "Impact": "Read Memory"}, {"Scope": "Integrity", "Impact": ["Modify Memory", "Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands"]}]}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": {"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Description": "Logic should be designed in a way that blown fuses do not put the product into an insecure state that can be leveraged by an attacker."}}, "Demonstrative_Examples": {"Demonstrative_Example": {"Intro_Text": {"xhtml:p": ["A chip implements a secure boot and uses the sensed value of a fuse \n         \"do_secure_boot\" to determine whether to perform a secure boot or not.
