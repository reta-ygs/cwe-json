Some shared resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially, without any interference by other processes.  Synchronization mechanisms vary widely, but they may include locking, mutexes, and semaphores.  When a multi-step operation on a shared resource cannot be guaranteed to execute independent of interference, then the resulting behavior can be unpredictable. Improper synchronization could lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc."}, "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": [{"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "664", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}, {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "691", "@View_ID": "1000"}, {"@Nature": "CanPrecede", "@CWE_ID": "362", "@View_ID": "1000"}]}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design"}, {"Phase": "Implementation"}]}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": ["Integrity", "Confidentiality", "Other"], "Impact": ["Modify Application Data", "Read Application Data", "Alter Execution Logic"]}}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": {"Phase": "Implementation", "Description": "Use industry standard APIs to synchronize your code."}}, "Taxonomy_Mappings": {"Taxonomy_Mapping": [{"@Taxonomy_Name": "CERT C Secure Coding", "Entry_ID": "SIG00-C", "Entry_Name": "Mask signals handled by noninterruptible signal handlers"}, {"@Taxonomy_Name": "CERT C Secure Coding", "Entry_ID": "SIG31-C", "Entry_Name": "Do not access shared objects in signal handlers", "Mapping_Fit": "CWE More Abstract"}, {"@Taxonomy_Name": "CLASP", "Entry_Name": "State synchronization error"}, {"@Taxonomy_Name": "The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011)", "Entry_ID": "VNA03-J", "Entry_Name": "Do not assume that a group of calls to independently atomic methods is atomic"}, {"@Taxonomy_Name": "Software Fault Patterns", "Entry_ID": "SFP19", "Entry_Name": "Missing Lock"}]}, "Related_Attack_Patterns": {"Related_Attack_Pattern": [{"@CAPEC_ID": "25"}, {"@CAPEC_ID": "26"}, {"@CAPEC_ID": "27"}, {"@CAPEC_ID": "29"}]}, "Notes": {"Note": {"@Type": "Maintenance", "#text": "Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms.
