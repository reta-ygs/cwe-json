For some cryptographic\n\t     protocols, these messages can be completely\n\t     prefabricated, as the resource-intensive part of the\n\t     handshake happens on the server-side first (such as TLS),\n\t     rather than on the client side. In the case of\n\t     cryptographic protocols where the resource-intensive part\n\t     should happen on the client-side first (such as SSH), a\n\t     malicious client can send a forged/precalculated\n\t     computation result, which seems correct to the server, so\n\t     the resource-intensive part of the handshake is going to\n\t     happen on the server side. A malicious client is required\n\t     to send only the initial messages of a cryptographic\n\t     handshake to initiate the resource-consuming part of the\n\t     cryptographic handshake. These messages are usually\n\t     small, and generating them requires minimal computational\n\t     effort, enabling a denial-of-service attack. An\n\t     additional risk is the fact that higher key size\n\t     increases the effectiveness of the attack. Cryptographic\n\t     protocols where the clients have influence over the size\n\t     of the used key (such as TLS 1.3 or SSH) are most at\n\t     risk, as the client can enforce the highest key
