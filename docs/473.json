An application should be reluctant to trust variables that have been initialized outside of its trust boundary. Ensure adequate checking is performed when relying on input from outside a trust boundary. Do not allow your application to run with register_globals enabled. If you implement a register_globals emulator, be extremely careful of variable extraction, dynamic evaluation, and similar issues, since weaknesses in your emulation could allow external variable modification to take place even without register_globals."}}, "Observed_Examples": {"Observed_Example": [{"Reference": "CVE-2000-0860", "Description": "File upload allows arbitrary file read by setting hidden form variables to match internal variable names.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-0860"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2001-0854", "Description": "Mistakenly trusts $PHP_SELF variable to determine if include script was called by its parent.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0854"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2002-0764", "Description": "PHP remote file inclusion by modified assumed-immutable variable.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0764"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2001-1025", "Description": "Modify key variable when calling scripts that don't load a library that initializes it.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1025"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2003-0754", "Description": "Authentication bypass by modifying array used for authentication.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0754"}]}, "Taxonomy_Mappings": {"Taxonomy_Mapping": {"@Taxonomy_Name": "PLOVER", "Entry_Name": "PHP External Variable Modification"}}, "Related_Attack_Patterns": {"Related_Attack_Pattern": {"@CAPEC_ID": "77"}}, "Notes": {"Note": {"@Type": "Relationship", "#text": "This is a language-specific instance of Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID).
