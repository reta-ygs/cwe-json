For example, the device can only endure a limited number of writes, after which the device becomes unreliable. In order to wear out the cells in a uniform manner, non-volatile memory and storage products based on the above-mentioned technologies implement a technique called wear leveling. Once a set threshold is reached, wear leveling maps writes of a logical block to a different physical block. This prevents a single physical block from prematurely failing due to a high concentration of writes. If wear leveling is improperly implemented, attackers may be able to programmatically cause the storage to become unreliable within a much shorter time than would normally be expected."}, "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "400", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Operating_System": {"@Class": "Not OS-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Architecture": {"@Class": "Not Architecture-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Technology": [{"@Class": "System on Chip", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, {"@Name": "Memory Hardware", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, {"@Name": "Storage Hardware", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}]}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design"}, {"Phase": "Implementation"}]}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": "Availability", "Impact": "DoS: Instability"}}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": {"Phase": ["Architecture and Design", "Implementation", "Testing"], "Description": "Include secure wear leveling algorithms and ensure they may not be bypassed.", "Effectiveness": "High"}}, "Demonstrative_Examples": {"Demonstrative_Example": {"Intro_Text": "An attacker can render a memory line unusable by repeatedly causing a write to the memory line.", "Body_Text": ["Below is example code from [REF-1058] that the user can execute repeatedly to cause line failure.
