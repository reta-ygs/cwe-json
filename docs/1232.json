The memory configuration lock can be set by the BIOS during the boot process.", "If such a system also supports a rapid power on mode like hibernate, the DRAM data must be saved to a disk before power is removed and restored back to the DRAM once the system powers back up and before the OS resumes operation after returning from hibernate."]}, "Body_Text": "To support the hibernate transition back to the operating state, the DRAM memory configuration must be reprogrammed even though it was locked previously. As the hibernate resume does a partial reboot, the memory configuration could be altered before the memory lock is set.

Lock settings and system configuration must be restored to the same state it was in before the device entered into the hibernate mode."}}, "Related_Attack_Patterns": {"Related_Attack_Pattern": {"@CAPEC_ID": "166"}}, "Content_History": {"Submission": {"Submission_Name": "Arun Kanuparthi, Hareesh Khattri, Parbati Kumar Manna, Narasimha Kumar V Mangipudi", "Submission_Organization": "Intel Corporation", "Submission_Date": "2020-01-15"}, "Modification": [{"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2020-08-20", "Modification_Comment": "updated Common_Consequences, Demonstrative_Examples, Description, Modes_of_Introduction, Potential_Mitigations, Related_Attack_Patterns"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2021-03-15", "Modification_Comment": "updated Description"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2023-04-27", "Modification_Comment": "updated Relationships"}]}}, "copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2006\u20132023, The MITRE Corporation.
