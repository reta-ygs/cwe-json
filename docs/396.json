{"cwe": {"@ID": "396", "@Name": "Declaration of Catch for Generic Exception", "@Abstraction": "Base", "@Structure": "Simple", "@Status": "Draft", "Description": "Catching overly broad exceptions promotes complex error handling code that is more likely to contain security vulnerabilities.", "Extended_Description": "Multiple catch blocks can get ugly and repetitive, but \"condensing\" catch blocks by catching a high-level class like Exception can obscure exceptions that deserve special treatment or that should not be caught at this point in the program. Catching an overly broad exception essentially defeats the purpose of a language's typed exceptions, and can become particularly dangerous if the program grows and begins to throw new types of exceptions. The new exception types will not receive any attention.", "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": [{"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "705", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}, {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "755", "@View_ID": "1000"}, {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "221", "@View_ID": "1000"}]}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": [{"@Name": "C++", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, {"@Name": "Java", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, {"@Name": "C#", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, {"@Name": "Python", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}]}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": {"Phase": "Implementation"}}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": ["Non-Repudiation", "Other"], "Impact": ["Hide Activities", "Alter Execution Logic"]}}, "Detection_Methods": {"Detection_Method": {"@Detection_Method_ID": "DM-14", "Method": "Automated Static Analysis", "Description": "Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
