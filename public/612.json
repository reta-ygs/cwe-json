{"@ID": "612", "@Name": "Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information", "@Abstraction": "Base", "@Structure": "Simple", "@Status": "Draft", "Description": "The product creates a search index of private or sensitive documents, but it does not properly limit index access to actors who are authorized to see the original information.", "Extended_Description": "Web sites and other document repositories may apply an indexing routine against a group of private documents to facilitate search.  If the index's results are available to parties who do not have access to the documents being indexed, then attackers could obtain portions of the documents by conducting targeted searches and reading the results.  The risk is especially dangerous if search results include surrounding text that was not part of the search query. This issue can appear in search engines that are not configured (or implemented) to ignore critical files that should remain hidden; even without permissions to download these files directly, the remote user could read them.", "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "1230", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design"}, {"Phase": "Implementation"}]}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": "Confidentiality", "Impact": "Read Application Data"}}, "Taxonomy_Mappings": {"Taxonomy_Mapping": {"@Taxonomy_Name": "WASC", "Entry_ID": "48", "Entry_Name": "Insecure Indexing"}}, "References": {"Reference": {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1050"}}, "Notes": {"Note": {"@Type": "Research Gap", "#text": "This weakness is probably under-studied and under-reported."}}, "Content_History": {"Submission": {"Submission_Name": "Anonymous Tool Vendor (under NDA)", "Submission_Date": "2007-05-07"}, "Modification": [{"Modification_Name": "Eric Dalci", "Modification_Organization": "Cigital", "Modification_Date": "2008-07-01", "Modification_Comment": "updated Time_of_Introduction"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2008-09-08", "Modification_Comment": "updated Description, Relationships, Other_Notes, Taxonomy_Mappings"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2009-10-29", "Modification_Comment": "updated Other_Notes, Research_Gaps"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2010-02-16", "Modification_Comment": "updated Taxonomy_Mappings"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2011-03-29", "Modification_Comment": "updated Name"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2011-06-01", "Modification_Comment": "updated Common_Consequences"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2012-05-11", "Modification_Comment": "updated Relationships"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2014-07-30", "Modification_Comment": "updated Relationships"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2017-11-08", "Modification_Comment": "updated Applicable_Platforms, Taxonomy_Mappings"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2020-02-24", "Modification_Comment": "updated Description, Name, References, Relationships, Type"}, {"Modification_Name": "CWE Content Team", "Modification_Organization": "MITRE", "Modification_Date": "2023-04-27", "Modification_Comment": "updated Relationships"}], "Previous_Entry_Name": [{"@Date": "2008-04-11", "#text": "Information Leak Through Insecure Indexing"}, {"@Date": "2011-03-29", "#text": "Information Leak Through Indexing of Private Data"}, {"@Date": "2020-02-24", "#text": "Information Exposure Through Indexing of Private Data"}]}}
