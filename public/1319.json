EM-FI attacks consist of producing a local, transient magnetic field near the device, inducing current in the device wires.

Fail by default coding - When checking conditions (switch or if) check all possible cases and fail by default because the default case in a switch (or the else part of a cascaded if-else-if construct) is used for dealing with the last possible (and valid) value without checking. This is prone to fault injection because this alternative is easily selected as a result of potential data manipulation [REF-1141].", "4.

Most devices in the MPC55xx and MPC56xx series that include the Boot Assist Module (BAM) (a serial or CAN bootloader mode) are susceptible to this attack. In this paper, a GM ECU was used as a real life target. While the success rate appears low (less than 2 percent), in practice a success can be found within 1-5 minutes once the EMFI tool is setup. In a practical scenario, the author showed that success can be achieved within 30-60 minutes from a cold start."}}, "Related_Attack_Patterns": {"Related_Attack_Pattern": [{"@CAPEC_ID": "624"}, {"@CAPEC_ID": "625"}]}, "References": {"Reference": [{"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1141"}, {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1142"}, {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1143"}, {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1144"}, {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1145"}, {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1146"}, {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1147"}, {"@External_Reference_ID": "REF-1285"}]}, "Notes": {"Note": {"@Type": "Maintenance", "#text": "This entry is attack-oriented and may require significant modification in future versions, or even deprecation.
