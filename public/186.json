{"@ID": "186", "@Name": "Overly Restrictive Regular Expression", "@Abstraction": "Base", "@Structure": "Simple", "@Status": "Draft", "Description": "A regular expression is overly restrictive, which prevents dangerous values from being detected.", "Extended_Description": "This weakness is not about regular expression complexity. Rather, it is about a regular expression that does not match all values that are intended. Consider the use of a regexp to identify acceptable values or to spot unwanted terms. An overly restrictive regexp misses some potentially security-relevant values leading to either false positives *or* false negatives, depending on how the regexp is being used within the code. Consider the expression /[0-8]/ where the intention was /[0-9]/.  This expression is not \"complex\" but the value \"9\" is not matched when maybe the programmer planned to check for it.", "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": [{"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "185", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}, {"@Nature": "CanAlsoBe", "@CWE_ID": "184", "@View_ID": "1000"}, {"@Nature": "CanAlsoBe", "@CWE_ID": "183", "@View_ID": "1000"}]}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": {"Phase": "Implementation"}}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": "Access Control", "Impact": "Bypass Protection Mechanism"}}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": {"Phase": "Implementation", "Description": "Regular expressions can become error prone when defining a complex language even for those experienced in writing grammars.
