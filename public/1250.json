For example, users of a social media service or a massively multiplayer online game might be using their own personal computers while also interacting with different physical hosts in a globally distributed service, but all participants must be able to have the same \"view\" of the world.  Alternately, a processor's Memory Management Unit (MMU) might have \"shadow\" MMUs to distribute its workload, and all shadow MMUs are expected to have the same accessible ranges of memory.", "In such environments, it becomes critical for\n\t\tthe product to ensure that this \"shared state\" is\n\t\tconsistently modified across all distributed systems.\n\t\tIf state is not consistently maintained across all\n\t\tsystems, then critical transactions might take place\n\t\tout of order, or some users might not get the same\n\t\tdata as other users.
