However, the attacker could then send a different signal that is associated with the same handler function. This could interrupt the original handler function while it is still executing. If there is shared state, then the state could be corrupted. This can lead to a variety of potential consequences depending on context, including denial of service and code execution.", "Another rarely-explored possibility arises when the signal handler is only designed to be executed once (if at all). By sending multiple signals, an attacker could invoke the function more than once. This may generate extra, unintended side effects. A race condition might not even be necessary; the attacker could send one signal, wait until it is handled, then send the other signal."]}, "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "364", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": ["Availability", "Integrity", "Confidentiality", "Access Control", "Other"], "Impact": ["DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart", "Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands", "Read Application Data", "Gain Privileges or Assume Identity", "Bypass Protection Mechanism", "Varies by Context"], "Note": "The most common consequence will be a corruption of the state of the product, possibly leading to a crash or exit.
