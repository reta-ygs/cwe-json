Among various types of message information, a typical transaction is comprised of source identity (to identify the originator of the transaction) and a destination identity (to route the transaction to the respective entity). Sometimes the transactions are qualified with a security identifier. This security identifier helps the destination agent decide on the set of allowed actions (e.g., access an asset for read and writes).", "A typical bus connects several leader and follower agents. Some follower agents implement bus protocols differently from leader agents. A protocol conversion happens at a bridge to seamlessly connect different protocols on the bus. One example is a system that implements a leader with the Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) protocol and a follower with the Open-Core Protocol (OCP). A bridge AHB-to-OCP is needed to translate the transaction from one form to the other.", "A common weakness that can exist in this scenario is that this conversion between protocols is implemented incorrectly, whereupon an untrusted agent may gain unauthorized access to an asset."]}, "Related_Weaknesses": {"Related_Weakness": [{"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "284", "@View_ID": "1000", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}, {"@Nature": "ChildOf", "@CWE_ID": "1294", "@View_ID": "1194", "@Ordinal": "Primary"}]}, "Applicable_Platforms": {"Language": {"@Class": "Not Language-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Operating_System": {"@Class": "Not OS-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Architecture": {"@Class": "Not Architecture-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, "Technology": [{"@Name": "Bus/Interface Hardware", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}, {"@Class": "Not Technology-Specific", "@Prevalence": "Undetermined"}]}, "Modes_Of_Introduction": {"Introduction": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Note": "Such issues could be introduced during hardware architecture and design, then identified later during Testing or System Configuration phases."}, {"Phase": "Implementation", "Note": "Such issues could be introduced during hardware implementation, then identified later during Testing or System Configuration phases."}]}, "Common_Consequences": {"Consequence": {"Scope": ["Confidentiality", "Integrity", "Availability", "Access Control"], "Impact": ["Modify Memory", "Read Memory", "DoS: Resource Consumption (Other)", "Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands", "Gain Privileges or Assume Identity", "Quality Degradation"], "Likelihood": "High"}}, "Potential_Mitigations": {"Mitigation": [{"Phase": "Architecture and Design", "Description": "Security identifier decoders must be reviewed for design inconsistency and common weaknesses."}, {"Phase": "Implementation", "Description": "Access and programming flows must be tested in pre-silicon and post-silicon testing."}]}, "Demonstrative_Examples": {"Demonstrative_Example": {"Intro_Text": {"xhtml:p": ["Consider a system that supports AHB.
